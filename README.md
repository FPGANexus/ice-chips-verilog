# ice-chips-verilog
IceChips is a library of all common discrete logic devices in Verilog

[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE.md)
[![Language][ico-language]](Source-7400)

[topdesc]: #desc
I'm focusing on the 74xx family: devices that were TTL originally (bipolar technologies such as LS, AS), that are now implemented as CMOS (HC, HCT, LV or many other technology variations)

#### Who
> Hobbyist who wants to program an FPGA, or do general digital circuit simulation, and wants to do it from already-proven building blocks (cores)

#### What
> Basic logic such as gates, registers, multiplexers, counters, adders, but also non-retriggerable monostable multivibrators

#### Why
> I noticed the [74xx][link-wiki7400] chips do not exist in one place as an open-source catalogue in Verilog (or in VHDL to my knowledge). To see them and create a simulation with them, you would need to open up the IDE (ISE) for Xilinx or Altera. You can find free [simulators and digital playgrounds][link-websim], but what to type in? You'll need [IceChips](Source-7400). ...Of course you could just buy a breadboard and the ICs. But that's going by different logic.

## What to Expect

* Each device validated by test bench
* Implemented formally by an overall Input/Output/Code template, with industry pin names, consistent Verilog
* Fully parametrized (so you could pretend that a quad or a hex buffer/line driver is actually 64 bits for your FPGA design; you could turn a triple 3-input NAND gate - the workhorse 7410 - into a heptal 5-input NAND gate just by plugging in the two numbers)

> Please contact me if you have a request (and the device number is less than about 74699!)

## Purpose

Using one module per logic device (in other words: encapsulated Verilog) promotes compositional design and bottom-up design so that hopefully large logic blocks/cores (from a crypto accelerator, or a [coin mining][link-coinmining] FPGA, to a CPU?) can be created if you validate and spec out each module, step by step. All you need to do is wire the modules together!

> Stay tuned because exciting things will happen once the library is built out a bit more!

## Usage
[usage]: #usage

The test benches can be run using the open-source simulator Icarus Verilog: [Installation][link-iverilogi], [Getting Started][link-iverilogs].

With it installed on your system you can run a command like the following that specifies the required input files and one output file (.vvp):
```
> iverilog -g2012 -o 7400-tb.vvp tbhelper.v 7400-tb.v 7400.v
```

It then requires a second step: Run the Icarus Verilog simulator/runtime to see the tests run, with results logged to the console:
```
> vvp 7400-tb.vvp
```

If you're interested in looking even closer, the above vvp run stores signal and timing data in the .vcd file, so run GTKWave viewer to see the waveform that is generated: [Installation][link-gtkwavei], [Getting Started][link-gtkwaves].

With GTKWave you can just click on the .vcd file to open.
