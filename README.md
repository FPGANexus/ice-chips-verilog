# ice-chips-verilog

[![Build Status][ico-travisci]][link-travisci]

The 74LS, 74HC, 74HCT family of chips in Verilog for Electronic Design Automation

    Fully validated by test bench · Parametrized code · DELAY parameters for timing simulation

IceChips is built to support the [Icestudio][link-icestudio] and [FPGAwars][link-fpgawars] manifesto:

    <Open Hardware driven by Open Source>

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use these devices is [download the collection](/releases/latest) and open it in the Icestudio design environment.

In Icestudio, go to `Tools > Collections > Add` and select the downloaded .zip file. Place and wire up your components, run and test the result. There's a variety of ways to provide inputs and view outputs; but no need for actual parts, wires or power supply.

Alternatively, you can download an individual device ([74xx.v file](source-7400/74153.v)) and use it in your own simulation in Verilog. This is the way to go if you wish to set the parameters for #bits, #inputs per gate, #blocks in a device. See the Index to browse devices.

## Index

## Icestudio Design Flow

Welcome to virtual breadboarding.

Icestudio provides circuit simulation (for digital circuits) that's arbitrarily scalable. Explore, build and create, but most importantly, get near-instant feedback in testing your real hardware design. Each time you add a new input or a gate, or an LED, hit "Build" and "Upload". In the parlance of a silicon fab, you've gone through a "spin". But you're actually programming a reusable and fairly inexpensive FPGA.

    CAD-style layout using drag & drop
        -> Full Verilog model
            -> Validation of design rules & connectivity
                -> Synthesis of circuit
                    -> Bitstream to FPGA
                        -> Live circuit to test or put in-situ

It's done with entirely open source tools (the IceStorm toolchain); and most of the magic is due to the representation in Hardware Description Language, i.e. Verilog:

- Once you have a system fully modelled in HDL, you have everything: The HDL is used to generate hardware in any way you require, in a process called [logic synthesis][link-wiki-synth];

- The toolchain can synthesize the circuit onto an expanding selection of FPGAs; see [Icestudio][link-icestudio] for details;

- Icestudio's graphical editing, with internal Verilog, makes it easy and explicit to work with the hierarchy and layering paradigm provided by Verilog; this promotes compositional design - being intentional about the boundary, the spec and the validation of each of your modules - which in turn means scalability and testability.

## Tests and Validation

A test bench accompanies every device (74xx-tb.v file with 74xx.v file) and the tests are run automatically. You can click on the "tests" badge below the main title at top of page to see the logged results.

Tests are a definitive feature of the library. Test coverage will continue at the highest standard as the library expands going forward.

You have to "trust but verify" when scaling up a hardware design from lower-layer components.

<details>
<summary>Test benches</summary>
<br />

IceChips tests must be:

1. Comprehensive
2. Meaningful (each test adding value)
3. Annotated with descriptions
4. Self-checking

The test benches are for documentation and transparency and create a kind of audit trail - that's in addition to their role in correctness!

Self-checking: Each test gives a Pass/Fail result. It does this by using an "assert" statement, that logs a failure message if the stated condition (at the output) is not met. The tests are not just doing a demonstration run of the device by way of a waveform output - although they do that also.

</details>

#### Validation Contract

IceChips is actually built around validation end-to-end. The code files are generated by script, from a template, and all the working parts come together to ensure the Verilog is validated reliably and completely.

Here's an overview, with a visual showing the structure of the code files:

&ensp;&ensp;[Validation scheme and contract](docs/validation-scheme.md) for the Verilog code files and the .ice components

&ensp;&ensp;[Direct to contract](docs/validation-scheme.md#the-contract)

Some nerdy stuff is included, by intention, such as [guidelines around test benches](docs/validation-scheme.md#what-is-a-good-test-bench) for open source purposes and community contribution.

#### Running the tests on your machine

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<br />

The test benches can be run using the open source simulator Icarus Verilog: [Installation][link-iverilogi], [Getting Started][link-iverilogs].

With it installed, you can run a command like the following that specifies the required input files and one output file (.vvp):
```
> iverilog -g2012 -o7400-tb.vvp ../includes/helper.v ../includes/tbhelper.v 7400-tb.v 7400.v
```

It then requires a second step: Run the Icarus Verilog simulator/runtime to see the tests run, with results logged to the console:
```
> vvp 7400-tb.vvp
```

If you're interested in looking even closer, the above "vvp" run stores all signal and timing data - inputs, outputs, and the connection paths between them - in a .vcd file, so run GTKWave viewer to see the run as a waveform: [Installation][link-gtkwavei], [Getting Started][link-gtkwaves].

With GTKWave installed, just click on the .vcd file to open.

Clarification about this design flow versus PCB (Printed Circuit Board) flow:

<details>
<summary>PCB design flow</summary>
<br />

Are you planning to populate your components onto a custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board)?

You have a head start from simulating and testing your design, because now you know you have a digital circuit that meets all its specs.

However, it's a different workflow area that you'll have to get into to create a PCB: A different type of visual editing ("schematic capture"); placing, routing and design of layout for manufacture; verification of design rules for manufacture (this time for geometric/electrical properties).

Note: Having said that, using 74xx standard parts will set you up well for using PCB software, since the parts are well-known and modelled for geometric/electrical properties.

The following keywords are related to PCBs and are **not** part of the present workflow:

- Ngspice
- SPICE
- Eagle
- Gerber format
- Most software programs that have CAD in them (KiCAD) and the ones that have PCB in them (LibrePCB)
- gEDA suite (for the most part)
